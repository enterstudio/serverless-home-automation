### TODO
This guide provides a step by step tutorial to equip users to control power outlets using a Raspberry PI. The voice/text commands to trigger the outlets will be processed by IBM Watson's natural language services.

## Hardware
This project requires the following hardware
- [Raspberry PI 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
- [GPIO Ribbon cable + Breakout Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/914)
- [433MHz RF transmitter and receiver](https://www.amazon.com/SMAKN%C2%AE-433Mhz-Transmitter-Receiver-Arduino/dp/B00M2CUALS)
- [Etekcity 433 MHz Outlets](https://www.amazon.com/Etekcity%C2%AE-Wireless-Control-Switches-included/dp/B00DQELHAE/)
- Electronic Breadboard

## Step 1: Register device to Watson IoT Platform
Login to [IBM Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net)

Select the service [Catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/) icon in the upper right

Select and create the "Watson IoT Platform" service

Once the Watson IoT Platform has been successfully created, click the "Launch" button to access the Dashboard

Register your Raspberry PI with the Watson IoT Platform. This can be done by navigating to the Devices tab in the dashboard, and selecting "Add Device"

![IoT Create Device](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-mqtt-bluemix-iot-node-red-app/image003.jpg)

Choose Create a device type for the Device Type option.

Fill in the Device Type as MQTTDevice. We will use that value later.

Fill in the Device ID with a unique id, for example, aabbccddee12. You may input your own identifier.

Next, create an api key. This key will be used to authenticate to the MQTT broker provided by the Watson IoT platform. This can be done by navigating to the API Keys tab, and selecting "New API Key"

Be sure to take note of the resulting apikey/token, as it will only be shown in the dashboard once

Place the credentials in

## Step 2: Install dependencies in Raspberry Pi
Login to Raspberry PI and install prerequisites for wiringPi library. This library allows a user to monitor and control the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core
git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
cd wiringPi
git pull origin
# Ensure wiringPi library is installed by running the following command. (https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/the-gpio-utility/)
gpio readall  
```
Install 433Utils, which will call the wiringPi library to transmit and receive messages via the 433MHz frequency
```
git clone git://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils.git
cd 433Utils/RPi_utils
make   
```
Arrange the transmitter, receiver, and breakout board into breadboard to complete the following circuit https://wi-images.condecdn.net/image/PxqdnRzYBzq/crop/810
Now we will determine which RF codes correspond with the Etekcity outlets. This can be done by simply running
```
sudo /var/www/rfoutlet/RFSniffer
```
Press the button on the Etekcity remote that corresponds with the outlet you'd like to control, if the receiver is wired correctly, you should see the following output.
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo /var/www/rfoutlet/RFSniffer
Received 5527308
Received pulse 190
Received 5527308
Received pulse 191
```

## Step 3: Run Script

Modify lines 41 and 46 to use the RF code that was detected by RFSniffer.

Next, run the node_mqtt.js file, which will listen on the proper mqtt channel for incoming messages from the nlc service. If the message matches a certain registered device and state, the "sendcode" command will be invoked to control the registered Etekcity outlet
```
sudo node node_mqtt.js
```
